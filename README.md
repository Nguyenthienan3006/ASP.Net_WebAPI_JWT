This project is a demo Web API application developed using ASP.NET Core, showcasing a basic implementation of JSON Web Token (JWT) for user authentication and authorization. The application features two primary functions: user login and registration. In the registration process, user passwords are securely hashed before storage, ensuring enhanced security. Upon login, JWTs are issued to authenticated users, allowing them access to secured endpoints. This setup demonstrates a straightforward yet effective approach to managing user sessions and secure data access in a Web API environment.
